# Welcome to the Alchemist
The Alchemist is a bot that helps you double your traffic by running your social media accounts on autopilot.

It endlessly schedules your social media. Thereby keeping your profiles fresh, while refilling itself without your input.

A more detailed explanation of the Alchemist processes and how it works can be found here:
[https://www.scrappycabin.com/blogs/the-alchemist-recipe](https://www.scrappycabin.com/blogs/the-alchemist-recipe)

## How does the Alchemist work?
- You start by adding your updates to your [content library](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cw_Wegrmo7imB5Uu06lydqXYOmWa5w6hc0kXsfz53xE/edit?usp=sharing).
- Set your schedule on Buffer
- And the Alchemist runs your social media on autopilot

In short, the Alchemist turns a social media scheduling tool (like a free Buffer account) into a powerful social media automation tool (like Edgar), with zero effort.
