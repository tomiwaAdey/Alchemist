# Welcome to the Alchemist
The Alchemist is a bot that helps you double your traffic by helping you run your social media accounts on autopilot.

It endlessly schedules your social media. Thereby keeping your profiles fresh, while refilling itself without your input.

A more detailed explanation of the Alchemist processes and how it works can be found here:

PS: It's still in draft, full guide coming soon :)

In short, the Alchemist turns a social media scheduling tool (like a free Buffer account) into a powerful social media automation tool (like Edgar), without spending a dime.
